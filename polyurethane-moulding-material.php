                    Historically, mouldings have primarily come in three types of material - Wood, Plaster and MDF.
                    But with recent research and innovation, carpenters are discovering that polymer-based materials can provide structural benefits
                    while maintaining the authenticity of quality. For interior mouldings, Polyurethane is emerging as a strong competitor to traditional
                    moulding materials. <a href="http://www.invitinghome.com/molding/about-crown-molding.htm">Inviting Home’s article on
                    Myths about Crown Moulding</a> dispels some of the common misconceptions that still exist.

                <h2>DESIGN AND INSTALLATION</h2>
                <p>
                    Our mouldings are easy to cut, and therefore leave little mess while minimizing any headaches from loud sawing.
                    Our trims are pre-moulded in a wide variety of designs, meaning that our designers have a large selecftion to choose from to perfectly match your style.
                    Having this stockpile ready to go allows us to finish our custom installation faster than most competitors.
                    We provide all of our materials primed and ready, making it easy to paint over top, or just clean periodically.

                    <!--Aside from structural properties, Polyurethane mouldings offer some interesting implications on design and installation.
                    Our mouldings are easy to cut, and therefore leave little mess while minimizing any headaches from loud sawing.
                    Our trims are pre-moulded in a huge variety of designs, meaning that our designers have a large selection of pieces to choose from to perfectly
                    match the style that you’re looking for. Having this stockpile of inventory ready to go allows us to finish our custom installation process faster
                    than most competitors. Finally, our Polyurethane mouldings come primed and ready for those who want to paint over top.-->

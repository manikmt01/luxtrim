                        and more, we discovered that High Density Polyurethane (PU) outperforms conventional materials on many metrics.</h4>

                        <h3>1. Physical Structure   2. Design Capabilities     3. Installation Efficiencies</h3>
                        <p>
                            Historically, mouldings have primarily come in three types of material - Wood, Plaster and MDF. But with recent research and innovation, 
                            carpenters are discovering that polymer-based materials can provide structural benefits while maintaining the authenticity of quality. 
                            For interior mouldings, Polyurethane is emerging as a strong competitor to traditional moulding materials. Inviting Home’s article on 
                            <a href="http://www.invitinghome.com/molding/about-crown-molding.htm">Myths about Crown Moulding</a> dispels some of the common misconceptions 
                            that still exist.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Aside from structural properties, Polyurethane mouldings offer some interesting implications on design and installation. Our mouldings are 
                            easy to cut, and therefore leave little mess while minimizing any headaches from loud sawing. Our trims are pre-moulded in a huge variety of 
                            designs, meaning that our designers have a large selection of pieces to choose from to perfectly match the style that you’re looking for. 
                            Having this stockpile of inventory ready to go allows us to finish our custom installation process faster than most competitors. Finally, our 
                            Polyurethane mouldings come primed and ready for those who want to paint over top.
